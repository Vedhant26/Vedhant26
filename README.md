👋 Hi, I’m Vedhant
B.Tech Student | Full-Stack Developer | AI/ML 
I am a Computer Science undergraduate focused on building practical, scalable, and impact-driven software solutions. My interests span full-stack web development, applied AI/ML, and systems that solve real-world problems through clean architecture and thoughtful design.
I enjoy working across the stack, learning fast, and improving code quality through iteration and feedback.
